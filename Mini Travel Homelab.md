1. The Mini Travel Homelab

• What is it? This homelab is for people who are new to IT or have an interest in
homelab and don't want to spend an upfront cost but also do not want to setup a
fully racked server using an eBay bought R730 which consumes a lot of electricity
and can be loud. We will be using a raspberry pi instead of the rackserver and
raspberry pi can be versatile for other projects however if you want to have a
powerful homelab but compact and still portable you can get an intel NUC on eBay
or amazon. What motivated me to start this was homelab have been my favorite
although we have cloud and is easier to have your servers on there for safer backup
and natural disaster I hate paying per month to have my server on there but I also
like to know hands on the psychical aspect of it and getting to know more on LAN
network to connect a device to the WAN internet.
